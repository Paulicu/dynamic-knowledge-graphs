\section{Conclusion}

To conclude, this paper examines the challenges and complexities of Dynamic Knowledge Graphs (DKGs), focusing on Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), and Entity Alignment (EA) tasks. 
While current methods offer valuable contributions, there are still considerable opportunities for further advancements. Incorporating ontological models, addressing the temporal aspects of 
multimodal data, and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for temporal reasoning could greatly improve the performance and applicability of DKGs. Further research in these areas has the 
potential to significantly enhance the effectiveness and scalability of DKG algorithms in practical settings.
