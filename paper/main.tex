        This paper explores the complexities of Dynamic Knowledge Graphs (DKGs) in the context Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), and Entity Alignment (EA). 
        It begins with a summary of a recent research article that establishes a foundation for understanding DKGs and their applications. 
        The paper then examines the current literature on DKG techniques, addressing key limitations such as the overreliance on graph-based representations and the insufficient handling of 
        temporal and multimodal data.
        In the proposal section, the paper suggests several directions for future research, such as incorporating ontological models, improving the integration of multimodal literals within 
        dynamic contexts, and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced temporal reasoning. These approaches aim to improve the adaptability, accuracy, and scalability of DKG 
        algorithms, leading to more effective solutions for dynamic data processing and knowledge representation in real-world applications.
